# Poke Center Menu

- HTML
- CSS
- LESS

A simple project, in which I bring a small idea of what a pokecenter management system would look like.

It has a login screen done with verification in Jscript, modeled and designed with HTML+CSS (using a cleaner code with Less).

After a simple verification, we have a Home screen, with a retractable menu, designed in FIGMA. Afterwards, analyze, build from HTML+ CSS, with functions produced from JScript
